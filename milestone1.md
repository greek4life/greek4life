# Project Idea:
Our project idea is about helping the elderly community with their daily lives by providing them with an app that alerts the elderly user via an alarm that they need to take their medication, provides instant communication with their caregiver, and displays a map of the nearest pharmacies that carry their prescriptions. This project idea fits the project theme because we are designing an app for the elderly, who have unique circumstances, such as dementia, that hinders their daily lives. In addition, none of us are part of the user population since all of us are relatively young. For the communication feature, we plan to use a messaging API from Twilio. We can use the Twilio API for SMS to allow the elderly community to send and receive text messages from their caregiver and family. For the maps feature, we plan to use the Google Maps API to indicate the closest pharmacies that carry an elderly person’s prescriptions.

Another project idea is about helping the caregivers of the elderly, who undergo a lot of stress caring for several elderly people, which leads to burnout in some cases. To help address their stress and burnout, we came up with an app that would allow the caregivers to pick certain elderly people that they could help care for based on the caregiver’s preferences for time allocation and personality of the elderly person. In addition, we would provide a platform to create caregiver support groups to help caregivers share their troubles and find people who are going through similar experiences each day. This project idea fits the project theme because we are designing an app for caregivers, who have unique circumstances, such as caring for numerous people, each of whom has health conditions specific to them. In addition, none of us are part of the user population since none of us are caregivers for the elderly community. For the picking elderly people feature, we could use a database of a local senior citizen community to quantify and better understand the personalities of elderly people, which will help caregivers pick their optimal choice. For the support group feature, we plan to use the Slack API to allow caregivers to form different groups via channels.

# Storyboards:
### Storyboard 1 - Far From Home:
This storyboard shows how our loved ones are far from us, so caretakers take care of our loved ones for us. However, caretakers are under a lot of stress with their busy and hectic schedules, which causes them to neglect their own physical and emotional needs. So, the caretaker uses our app to streamline the caretaking process, which allows the caretaker to take better care of themselves.

### Storyboard 2 - Distant Memory:
This storyboard shows how we forget things, such as taking medication and exercising, more frequently as we age. So, the elderly use our app to remember their everyday tasks. They go for a walk, stay up to date on their medication with the help of a caretaker, and see any upcoming events.

### Prototype 2:
##### Screens 1-3 - Login Page and Sign-Up Page
These screens show the login page of our mobile app with our logo at the top, options to sign up, login, or learn more about the app, and a short description of our app. When the user clicks on 'Sign Up', they are taken to the Sign Up Page (screen 2) with the option to click that the user is a caregiver or care receiver. In this case, the user clicks on care receiver and is taken to the care receiver sign up page (screen 3). There, they can input their personal information to create an account.
