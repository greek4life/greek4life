# Project Idea:
Contrary to our milestone 1 idea, we have switched our target population from the elderly to creative influencers in the musical industry. They are immensely popular among the young generation that loves to dance at the tune of various genres of music. From weddings to birthdays and from dance festivals to casual pool-side parties, music artists from different genres can be found everywhere. However, the phenomenal rise in the popularity of these artists has left aspiring artists searching for gigs and producers to put their talents on display for all to hear. Additionally, producers want to save time finding the right artist for their next project. In the end, producers want to collaborate with artists in hopes of gaining success. Using SoundCloud’s API, our hope is to embed an artist’s work into a list of search results for producers looking to collaborate and grow a brand. After a producer has listened to an artist’s work, they have the option to engage with their profile and check out their social media presence in addition to the rest of their musical portfolio. If they like what they see (and hear), the producer can then message the artist and proceed from this point as they see fit. This process allows the musical artists to continue to work on creating their mixes and hone in on their craft. At the same time, producers are engaging with them daily with the hope of finding the perfect fit!

# Screenshots:
### Screen 1 - Home Page:
![Screenshot](/milestone2_pics/home_page.jpg)
This is a screenshot of our application's home page wherein producers will be able to search for artists based on which city they are currently located in. For now, we have limited our population of artists to those located in California. From here, producers will be able to parse through a list of profiles that are located within their desired city. If a producers likes what they see, they can choose to "Connect with Artist" at which point they will be brought to their profile. They may choose to connect via email or use any one of the artist's social media accounts to intiate a direct message. This screenshot is different from our paper prototypes from milestone 1 in that instead of having our home page simply display our logo with an 'Enter' button, we remove that screen and allow the user to instantly start searching for music artists, thereby reducing the friction caused by having to click the 'Enter' button. In addition, the user can instantly know the purpose of our app when getting to the first page of our current app (the home page) since the title reads 'Search for Artists' followed by the notion that they need to search for a city in California, so there is no misinterpretation of the search function. Furthermore, this screenshot is for a desktop app, whereas our second prototype made it seem that our app was a mobile app.
### Screen 2 - Profile Page:
![Screenshot](/milestone2_pics/profilepage.png)
This is a screenshot of our profile page where users are able to insert their account information in addition to their social media handles. Music artists can specify what city they are located in as well as their preferred genre of music in order to match them with producers who are in the area and have the same interest in genre. Additionally, the inclusion of their social media handles will allow producers to gauge how influential these artists already are by way of their follower count on Twitter and Instagram as well as how many plays they have on Soundcloud. Once the user clicks "Add to Profile", their information will be added to our database and they will appear on the Home Page if a producer is looking for someone that fits their description. his screenshot is different from our paper prototypes from milestone 1 in that we created a profile page for the user to save their personal information and social media handles, so that users could come back to our app and see if there are any new artists that match what the producers are looking for without forcing the producers to input their information each time they use our app. Again, this screenshot is for a desktop app, whereas our second prototype made it seem that our app was a mobile app.
