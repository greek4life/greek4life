### Screen 1 - Home Page (Select Search Page):

From the last milestone, our former search page allowed producers to look for music artists based in a certain city within California. However, the motive behind our application has changed slightly in that the intended users are DJs looking to build their portfolio. From this page, a user is able to search by one of two options: song name or beats per minute (BPM). If a user chooses to search by song name, the user will need to input a song name, and our application will return a list of songs that have either the same or a similar number of beats per minute (BPM). Conversely, if the user knows how many beats per minute (BPM) he or she would like a song to have but does not have an idea of which songs to use, the user will need to input his or her favorite genres and a valid BPM value, and our application will recommend songs to them based on the specific criteria. This page has improved upon the previous version of our app in that we allow the user the option to pick which musical characteristic to search for, whether that characteristic is the song name or genres and BPM. This option provides greater usability and control for the user.

### Screens 2 and 3 - Search by Song Name Page and Search by BPM Page:

Our last milestone included a page that allowed producers to input their contact information as well as social media credentials for the purpose of building up their profile. The new pages that we have decided to include here show search results from a DJ looking to find songs similar to those that they have already included in some of their playlists. By using the Spotify API, our application is able to match a user's input of either a song name or genres and BPM to other songs that have a similar beats per minute (BPM) count. These pages have improved upon the previous version of our app in that the search function is the core feature of our app and provides a practical use case for real DJs to use, unlike the simple contact info page from last milestone.
