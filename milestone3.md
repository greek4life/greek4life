### Screen 1 - Select Search Page:

Our former search page allowed producers to look for music artists based in a certain city within California. However, the motive behind our application has changed slightly in that the intended users are DJs looking to build their portfolio. From this page, a user is able to search by one of two options; song name or beats per minute/key. If a user chooses to search by song name, our application will return a list of songs that have the same number of beats per minute or are written in the same key. Conversely, if the user knows how many beats per minute they'd like a song to have, but donâ€™t have an idea of which songs to use our application will recommend songs to them based on the criteria they specified.

### Screen 2 - Search by (Song Name/Tempo Key):

Our last milestone included a page that allowed producers to input their contact information as well as social media credentials for the purpose of building up their profile. The new page we have decided to include here shows search results from a DJ looking to find songs similar to those that they have already included on some of their tracks. By using the Spotify API, our application is able to match a user's inputted song to other songs (or parts of songs) that have a similar beats per minute count or are in a certain key.
