# Non-Trivial Actions

### Song Playback

The first non-trival feature we have chosen to implement in our application is the ability to play songs back through the user interface. After the user receives a list of songs from searching by either song title or beats per minute, they can hear a sample of the song from Spotify. The song is played by clicking anywhere on the album cover artwork, song title, or album title. Currently, the user has the ability to stop a song from playing by flipping the "Playback" option from *Yes* to *No*.

### Save Songs to Profile

The second non-trivial action we have implemented in our application allows a user to save songs to their profile so that they can be accessed later. This can be achieved on either search page depending on whether the user chooses to search by song title or by beats per minute. Once the list of songs appears, a user can then save the song by clicking the *Save This Song!* button. Once songs are saved to a user's profile they can navigate to their page and see their favorites displayed in a list.
