# Target Population Utility:

These days beatmatching is considered basic among DJs in electronic dance music genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle. One of the key things to consider when beatmatching is the tempo of both songs, and the musical theory behind the songs. Attempting to beatmatch songs with completely different beats per minute will result in one of the songs sounding too fast or too slow. As a DJ using our application with a song title or audio rate in mind, one can search for new songs of the same BPM to add to their arsenal. This prevents any sort of discrepancy when beatmatching and ensures that any song in the resulting list will be a good fit. Furthermore, the ability for a user to save songs in our application allows for continuous construction of their repertoire of songs. Once a DJ has built up a sufficient amount of audio, they can then begin building a synchronized, harmonic mix for their next gig!

### Screen 1 - Home Page (Index Page):

From the last milestone, not much has changed in terms of affordances of the home page. Users are still able to look for song recommendations based on one of two criteria: beats per minute (BPM) or song name. Additionally, DJs still have the option to see their library of saved music, in case they navigate away from the application for some period of time or are looking to store a large number of songs. We have, however, altered the look and feel of the home page with the goal of making the music-finding experience even more intuitive for the user. The new color scheme is more appealing to the eye and helps guide the user's attention toward areas on the screen that are useful for them.

### Data Visualization

*A written explanation (***including screenshot***) of how you implemented your data display or visualizations, such as which libraries/frameworks you used (if any), how you hooked up to data APIs or databases, etc. (Again, you don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)*

# Ambitious Data Display

*Contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel free to be more creative here.*
