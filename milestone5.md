# Target Population Utility:

These days beatmatching is considered basic among DJs in electronic dance music genres, and it is standard practice in clubs to keep the constant beat through the night, even if DJs change in the middle. One of the key things to consider when beatmatching is the tempo of both songs, and the musical theory behind the songs. Attempting to beatmatch songs with completely different beats per minute will result in one of the songs sounding too fast or too slow. As a DJ using our application with a song title or audio rate in mind, one can search for new songs of the same BPM to add to their arsenal. This prevents any sort of discrepancy when beatmatching and ensures that any song in the resulting list will be a good fit. Furthermore, the ability for a user to save songs in our application allows for continuous construction of their repertoire of songs. Once a DJ has built up a sufficient amount of audio, they can then begin building a synchronized, harmonic mix for their next gig!

### Data Visualization

*A written explanation (***including screenshot***) of how you implemented your data display or visualizations, such as which libraries/frameworks you used (if any), how you hooked up to data APIs or databases, etc. (Again, you don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)*

# Ambitious Data Display

*Contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel free to be more creative here.*
